# A Course Rating API Built With Express
The back end for a "Course Rating Application" which lets users create, edit and rate courses.  
The API will provide a way for users to review educational courses: users can see a list of courses in a database; add courses to the database; and add reviews for a specific course.  
Built using Express and MongoDB.
